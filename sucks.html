	<h3>I'm feeling WEIRD. I applied to several graduate programs for an MFA in Acting and... nothing. Literally nothing. Let me back up.</h3>
	<h3>I applied to around 12. Of those 12, 2 decided that they're no longer going to have an MFA program in the next year. I had a total of 6? 7? auditions, spanning across one week of high hopes and disappointment. Okay. I'll re-frame it. Not disappointment, but a re-imagining of what my future holds and how I'm going about pursuing this whole acting thing.</h3>
	<h3>I started off with my audition for USC. I wasn't super excited for this audition, as I was under the impression that USC was expensive. Nope. Turns out, unlike they advertise on their website, the program is totally free. No stipend, like a lot of other programs, but still free. It was my first audition of the week, I was super excited. They asked me to look them in the eye while presenting my two monologues, and I did. I felt really good about it! I walked away confident that no matter what happens, I gave a kick-ass audition.</h3>
