                <h3>I was a crybaby as a kid. Actually– let me rephrase that. I was a little… sensitive. Some
                    people might not agree with my use of that qualifying word, “little.” Every adult in my life used
                    to tell me that I was too emotional, too sensitive. And maybe I was, but… I was also a child. I
                    always felt that my emotions were too big for my little body, like they filled me all the way up,
                    as if I were a vessel. But sometimes, the vessel would be jostled. And some of that liquid
                    emotion, syrupy and sticky and sour, would… spill out. It made a mess, always. But grown-ups
                    don’t like mess. They yell and curse when something spills. It’s another thing to clean up. And
                    I’d spill my emotion on things that weren’t meant to be tainted– games and jokes and teasing
                    little comments that they were hoping to forget after the fact.</h3> 
                    <br>
                <h3>As I got older, my vessel grew. My capacity for emotion– my ability to stop the spill– got
                    stronger. Then sometimes, someone didn’t just jostle me. They filled it up a little more, usually
                    not all the way to the top, but enough that I was worried about spilling. Sometimes, it wasn’t
                    even a person who’d fill it up, but a series of uncontrollable circumstances. The world shut down
                    with the pandemic when I was nineteen, and suddenly I was full.</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>I found that shortly after this shut down, my vessel did the same. It froze. Locked itself
                    up with a lid and a latch so that nothing could come out. And shortly after that nothing was real,
                    and I couldn’t go about my day without feeling as if I were dreaming. I was really, really scared
                    by it. I remember this one time, on a drive with my sister, I was sitting in the passenger seat, my
                    hand out the window, waving in the wind, you know, like they do in movies– and I was hit by
                    that feeling of unreality. Or, I guess it’s less of a hit of something and more of a sucking out of
                    everything, an hourglass suddenly devoid of sand. The lid was on, air-sealed, immovable. I was
                    in this state where nothing felt real, and I looked at my hand out the window. And it was made of
                    clay. It wasn’t mine. It didn’t belong to a body, it was an image out of a movie that was being
                    filmed by the camera in my head, separated from anything tangible. And I’d go to work, feeling
                    like a simulation of a person, empty and fictional and synthetic. But I always snapped out of it
                    after a minute, or an hour, or a week. Then that state became less frequent, like the lid was
                    opening slowly and laboriously, crack by crack.</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>In the summer, my grandmother died. It was the first death– the first human one, anyway,
                    that I’d ever experienced. I’d lost pets, and I’d known of people that had died, but it was never
                    someone so close to me, someone who I loved so dearly. And yes, I’m lucky: twenty years old
                    and experiencing death for the first time. And as much as I’d cried in my childhood, I had never
                    cried as much as I did the night she died. She’d had a lot of medical issues in the past. The
                    woman had half a lung by the time she passed… not one and a half lungs, one half of one lung,
                    the half that was left over from the cancer. She’d also had breast cancer. Twice. Every Christmas
                    for the past five years was prefaced with the same statement from my father: “This might be the
                    last one with Grandma.” I was prepared. I thought I was prepared.</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>When we got home from the hospital, she was still alive. The four of us– my sister, my
                    parents, and I– sat in silence in our living room for a while before turning on Pineapple Express.
                    Something to lighten the mood. Stoner humor, ha ha. Fifteen minutes into the movie, Dad got a
                    call from my uncle. “Mom’s not breathing. I’m over an hour away. Can you get back to the
                    hospital?” I wanted to go with them. So badly. I knew that going with would be devastating, but
                    anything beat sitting at home and waiting for a call. And I knew what the call was going to be. I
                    knew that when they broke the news to me, I wouldn’t be there to hug them. I would have to wait
                    for them to get home, however many hours later. My sister and I stayed in the living room for an
                    hour and a half, pacing. And we couldn’t do anything to pass the time, nothing felt appropriate.
                    Why bother entertaining myself when the worst thing that had ever happened to me was
                    happening, and I was just waiting to receive the news of it, the confirmation that it had actually
                    happened?</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>Around eleven o’clock I got a call from my mom. I put her on speakerphone so my sister
                    could hear. And she confirmed that the awful thing had happened, but that they had things they
                    needed to do with the hospital and that she couldn’t stay on the phone, and that they didn’t know
                    when they’d be home. We told each other that we loved each other and she asked if we were
                    okay, and we lied. Then we asked her if she was okay, and she lied. And she hung up. I wanted to
                    stay up downstairs and wait for them to get home. I didn’t want to be alone. But my sister is a
                    private griever. She retreated to her bedroom. Eventually, I got tired of waiting for them to come
                    home and went to bed.</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>That night, and the days following it, were bad days for my vessel. It was shaken every
                    which way, put on its side and upside down, jostled like an open paint can in a pneumatic shaker.
                    And a week or two later, the vessel was empty. Not a single drop left. I’d shake it myself,
                    wishing for something to come out. But nothing did. I felt numb. And I said to my mom, a few
                    days after she’d passed, that I’d stopped feeling. That nothing felt real. Her death was a fact,
                    nothing more. It had no emotional weight to it. Like, fact: Grandma died. As if it were an
                    inconsequential comment in the morning news, or an interesting something-or-other that a friend
                    had relayed to me as we lay on our backs on my bedroom floor, staring at our phones. Fact:
                    Grandma died. Fact: I was never going to see her again. Fact: I’d never spend another Christmas
                    eating her rock-hard chocolate-chip cookies. Fact: None of that made me feel anything. I felt like
                    my crying was a performance. My body understood the nature of what was happening, but my
                    brain didn’t.</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>But then a few months passed, and I started to notice something about my vessel. It felt
                    empty and full at the same time, shaken and still, open and closed. I found that it was just…
                    existing… oxymoronically. I looked into it for the first time in a long time, peering at the bottom.
                    Trying to, anyway. But only trying, you see, because I noticed that my vessel no longer had a
                    bottom. It was like Mary Poppins’ bag, like someone had replaced the wooden bottom of this
                    barrel with a black hole. It was then that I realized I hadn’t cried, not really cried, in months. The
                    little girl whose vessel was once too small for all of her emotion suddenly had a bottomless one
                    and was forced to wrestle anything out of it. I haven’t sobbed in a long time. Because after that,
                    after losing someone, everything else seems trivial. I haven’t yet experienced a pain greater than
                    that. Other reasons to cry suddenly seem undeserving of the energy. Like I’d be insulting her to
                    cry over anything else.</h3>
                    <br>
                <h3>So here I am, stuck with a bottomless emotional vessel, waiting for the next time
                    something really bad happens just so I can cry again. I have moments. I can feel the vessel fill
                    up, almost to the tippy-top and about to spill over. And then, as if someone attached a vacuum to
                    the bottom of the barrel, it’s gone. And I remember that nothing matters but her, but her death
                    and what I’m left with. And I know that I got something out of this. I can almost point to it, far
                    away and blurry, I know it’s there. But I can’t make out what it is. What did I get out of this?
                    Grief? A sense of loss? What can I take away? I know that’s the grief talking, the disassociated
                    part of my brain refusing to accept the fact that she’s gone. But sometimes, I’m terrified that all I
                    can take away from this is that I don’t think I’ll ever finish Pineapple Express.</h3>
