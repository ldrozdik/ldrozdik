                <h3>Hey. It's been a while. A little over two years. Well. There's a reason why I'm back, and it's very exciting. To me, anyway.</h3>
                <h3>I've been itching to have a personal website for eons, and I'm dating someone who is all into data and coding and all that fun stuff. But he got me into it. And I realized that I could develop my own personal and professional website, have all of my creative work on here, and bam! I learned how to code.</h3>
                <h3>I picked it up pretty fast, and built this site in a little over a day. I wanted to make the site a homepage for all of my creative endeavors, and that includes my blog. I've decided to update this more often, not really because anyone is going to read it, but because it's a nice place for me to put my thoughts. A very public journal.</h3>
                <h3>I also wanted to start writing again because I have some pretty cool stuff coming up. I'm auditioning for a bunch of graduate acting programs in the next few weeks, and figured I'd try to document it. I want to do a vlog, and then this can just be supplemental. But the process for auditions is crazy and I'm going to have quite the week ahead of me. I think a lot of people like me who are trying to get into an MFA are also going through the same things, so maybe documenting my experience with the scariest thing I've ever done will help someone else out there who feels like they're flying a little blind. Plus, I want to be able to look back on this time, reflect on my feelings, the whirlwind of it all. It'll be interesting to look at this when I'm in a different place in my career and hopefully reflect on the growth I've made.</h3>
                <h3>Other things have been happening. I just started a job as an IT Associate at my public library, and it's been great. I kind of just sit and wait for people to need help with printing or something else technology-related, and otherwise have time to work on learning new things (like code!). I'm at the library as I type this, enduring a particularly slow shift with about 2 hours left to go.</h3>
                <h3>I also started a job in marketing at a cybersecurity firm out of Batavia. It's been incredibly educational, and I'm realizing that I actually have a knack for this tech stuff! I got the job because of my creative writing skills, but I've been excelling more than I could have imagined. Now I'm considering a career in tech as a backup in case the acting thing doesn't work out. Or, I could use a tech career to supplement an acting career. I'm learning a lot about the industry and myself, and it's been an interesting ride. I'm excited to see where this takes me.</h3>
                <h3>I do think it's interesting, having all of this creative work just out there for anyone to stumble upon. My best writing is on this website. I wonder if anyone will stumble across it. Probably not, but it's cool to have it on here anyway. And I'm excited to see where I take this whole code thing. My boyfriend, Enan, is helping me with it and he's been so helpful in getting this website up and running.
                </h3>
                <h3>Anyways, I'm gonna sign off for now. TTYLXOX</h3>
